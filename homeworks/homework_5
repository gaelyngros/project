This homework concerns functions.

1. Make a function that reads in data and does some sort of manipulation of it. Undergrads, use the surveys dataset. Graduates, use your own data. Any manipulation is fine: selection, filtering, value removal. 



``` {r = eval, FALSE}
ac_data <- read_csv ("ac_field_data.csv")
filter_red <- function(dataset = ac_data) {
red_river <- (Month == 6 & Day <= 10)  %>% 
  return(red_river)
}

ac_data <- read_csv ("ac_field_data.csv")
filter_sabine <- function(dataset = ac_data) {
  sabine_river <- (Month == 6 & Day <= 23)  %>% 
    return(sabine_river)
}

ac_data <- read_csv ("ac_field_data.csv")
filter_ouachita <- function(dataset = ac_data) {
  ouachita_river <- (Month == 8)  %>% 
    return(ouachita_river)
}
```

2. Add a test to this function. How will you know if it worked, and alert a user if it did not?

```{r}
ac_data <- read_csv ("ac_field_data.csv") 
filter_red <- function(dataset = ac_data) {
red_river <- (Month == 6 & Day <= 10)  %>% 
if (red_river(Month > 6 & Day > 10)) {
  return(red_river)
} else {
  print ("Coordinates don't match!")
    }
}


```

3. Make a function that makes a plot. This can be any type of plot that we covered. Violin, box, scatter. Include the ability to save the plot to a file in the function.

```{r}
# Answer here
```

4. For saving to a file, users of your function may want the ability to choose their file name. Make the filename an argument so that users can do so.

```{r}
# Answer here.

```
